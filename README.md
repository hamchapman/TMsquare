TMsquare
========
An implementation of a Turing machine that will output the square of its input.

Written as part of my dissertation on Computability and Complexity Theory. 

When run it will ask you to input a number in zero-form, i.e. input a string with the number of 0s equal to the number you want to saure. The output to the console will then be a series of strings that represent what the machine's tape would look like going through the computation.
